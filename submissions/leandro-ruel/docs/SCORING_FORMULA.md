# Sales Pipeline Scoring Formula

## Overview

The Sales Pipeline Scorecard uses a comprehensive scoring algorithm to help sales teams prioritize deals by success probability. The score ranges from 0-100 and is calculated from five key factors.

## Scoring Components

### 1. **Deal Stage Score** (0-25 points)
**What it measures:** How far along the deal is in the sales pipeline

- **Prospecting** (5 points): Initial contact stage
- **Engaging** (15 points): Active negotiation stage
- **Won** (25 points): Closed won
- **Lost** (0 points): Closed lost

**Why it matters:** Deals further along the pipeline are more likely to close. Moving from Prospecting to Engaging is a significant milestone.

### 2. **Account Size Score** (0-20 points)
**What it measures:** The quality and stability of the customer company

Calculated as average of:
- **Employee Count** (0-10 points): More employees = larger company = more stable
- **Annual Revenue** (0-10 points): Higher revenue = better financial health

**Formula:**
```
Account Score = employee_score (0-10) + revenue_score (0-10)
```

where `revenue` is stored in millions of dollars ($M):

```
employee_score = min(10, (employees / 10000) × 10)   // 10,000+ employees = full points
revenue_score  = min(10, (revenue / 2000) × 10)      // $2B+ revenue = full points
```

**Examples (real dataset values):**
- Startup (9 employees, $4.5M revenue): ~0 points
- Mid-size (495 employees, $251M revenue): ~1 point
- Large (2,822 employees, $1.1B revenue): ~8.3 points
- Enterprise (34,288 employees, $11.7B revenue): 20 points

**Why it matters:** Larger, more established companies are more likely to:
- Follow through on commitments
- Have budgets approved
- Close within expected timeframes

---

### 3. **Seller Performance Score** (0-20 points)
**What it measures:** The sales agent's historical success with similar deals

Calculated from:
- **Historical Win Rate**: Percentage of deals this agent has won
- **Average Deal Value**: Size of typical deals this agent closes

**Formula:**
```
Seller Score = (win_rate × 20) + (agent_avg_deal_value / portfolio_avg × 5)
```

**Examples:**
- New agent (20% win rate): 4-8 points
- Average agent (50% win rate): 10-12 points
- Top agent (80% win rate): 16-20 points

**Why it matters:** Experience and track record strongly predict future success. Top performers close more deals.

---

### 4. **Product Performance Score** (0-20 points)
**What it measures:** How well this specific product performs in the market

Calculated from:
- **Historical Win Rate**: What percentage of this product's sales close
- **Market Performance**: How often customers choose this product tier

**Formula:**
```
Product Score = (product_win_rate × 20)
```

**Examples:**
- Struggling product (25% win rate): 5 points
- Standard product (50% win rate): 10 points
- Popular product (80% win rate): 16 points

**Why it matters:** Some products have stronger market demand and easier sales paths than others.

---

### 5. **Time on Pipeline Score** (0-15 points)
**What it measures:** Deal velocity - how long the deal stays in pipeline

**Formula:** Rewards deals in "sweet spot" of 100-120 days:
```
if (days_on_pipeline <= 120):
    score = (days_on_pipeline / 120) × 15
else:
    score = max(0, 15 - ((days_on_pipeline - 120) / 50))
```

**Examples:**
- New deal (10 days): 1.3 points
- Optimal deal (100 days): 12.5 points
- Optimal deal (120 days): 15 points
- Stalled deal (200 days): 4.2 points
- Very stalled deal (300 days): 0 points

**Why it matters:**
- **Too short**: Might close on impulse (high risk)
- **100-120 days**: Proper due diligence done (low risk)
- **Too long**: May indicate problems - buyer changed mind, stalled negotiations, etc.

---

## Total Score Calculation

### Formula:
```
TOTAL SCORE = Stage Score + Account Score + Seller Score + Product Score + Time Score
            = (0-25) + (0-20) + (0-20) + (0-20) + (0-15)
            = 0-100
```

### Success Probability:
```
SUCCESS PROBABILITY = TOTAL SCORE / 100
```

## Score Ranges & Interpretation

| Score Range | Category | Win Probability | Recommended Action |
|-----------|----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| 75-100 | 🟢 Excellent | 75-100% | **Priority 1**: Focus resources, likely to close |
| 60-74 | 🔵 Good | 60-74% | **Priority 2**: Monitor closely, support as needed |
| 45-59 | 🟡 Fair | 45-59% | **Priority 3**: Check on status, may need intervention |
| 0-44 | 🔴 Poor | 0-44% | **Priority 4**: Low probability, consider revisiting |

## Example Scorecard

### Deal: ABC Corp - GTX Pro

| Component | Points | Reason |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Deal Stage | 15 | In Engaging stage |
| Account Size | 18 | 5,000 employees, $200M revenue |
| Seller Performance | 16 | Agent has 75% win rate |
| Product Performance | 14 | GTX Pro has 70% close rate |
| Time on Pipeline | 12 | 100 days - optimal duration |
| **TOTAL** | **75** | **Excellent - 75% success probability** |

**Interpretation:** This is a high-priority deal. The seller is experienced, the account is solid, and the deal has been in pipeline for the right amount of time. This should close.

## Example Scorecard 2

### Deal: XYZ Corp - MG Special

| Component | Points | Reason |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Deal Stage | 5 | Still in Prospecting stage |
| Account Size | 8 | 200 employees, $15M revenue - small company |
| Seller Performance | 6 | Agent has 30% win rate |
| Product Performance | 6 | MG Special has 30% close rate |
| Time on Pipeline | 2 | Only 5 days - too early to tell |
| **TOTAL** | **27** | **Poor - 27% success probability** |

**Interpretation:** This deal is very early stage. The seller has weak history, the product underperforms, and the company is small. This needs significant attention and nurturing before it's likely to close.
